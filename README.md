Contributors: None </br>

This project explores the rental real estate market using a dual approach: predictive modeling to forecast rental prices and clustering techniques to segment the market based on property characteristics. By integrating these methods, we provide data-driven insights to help stakeholders optimize pricing, marketing, and investment strategies.

Key findings reveal that different renter segments prioritize either property quality or affordability, emphasizing the need for tailored marketing strategies. High-end apartments should be promoted for their amenities, while mid-range and affordable units benefit from pricing and location-based marketing. The model also aids investors in identifying high-yielding properties, helping them allocate resources effectively.

Ultimately, this analysis empowers renters, investors, and property owners to make informed decisions, enhancing market competitiveness and profitability in the evolving rental landscape.
